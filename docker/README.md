Ajit's Docker Images
=========================
Maintainer: Anshuman Dhuliya (anshumandhuliya@gmail.com)

Each of the three folders here contains the
following useful scripts,

1. `./build.sh` is used to build a fresh docker image
   after any changes.
2. `./run.sh` runs the docker image.
3. `./remove.sh` removes a running docker image (container).
4. `attach_shell`. Source this file to get a bash shell
   to the running docker container.
5. `./logs.sh` shows the output logs generated by the container.
