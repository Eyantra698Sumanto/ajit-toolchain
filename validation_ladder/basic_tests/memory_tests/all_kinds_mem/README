A test which checks the following types of
memory accesses using a simple march algorithm.
	- to cacheable pages
	- to non-cacheable pages
	- bypasses.

You can decide where to place the text and data
sections.  In this directory there are two VMAP
files.

	a. VMAPLOWMEM.TXT
		place text at 0x0, data start at 0x8000.
		
		Compile script is invoked as (assuming 80MHz system):

		./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x0 0x8000 VMAPLOWMEM.TXT 80000000

	a. VMAPHIGHMEM.TXT
		place text at 0x40000000, data start at 0x4008000.
		
		Compile script is invoked as (assuming 80MHz system):

		./compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 0x40000000 0x40008000 VMAPLOWMEM.TXT 80000000
