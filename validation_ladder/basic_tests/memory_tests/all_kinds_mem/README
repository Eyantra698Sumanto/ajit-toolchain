A test which checks the following types of
memory accesses using a simple march algorithm.
	- to cacheable pages
	- to non-cacheable pages
	- bypasses.

	KC705Platform.log file contains output of this 
	program tested on the KC705 FPGA Platform.

	Bitfile Generation date: 28 Jan 2021 

Usage for the KC705 Platform: 
	1. Source the bin-utils required for AJIT processor.
	2. Compile the program by running compile_for_ajit_uclibc.sh 
		script
	3. Using the 'run_at_high_mem.s' script 
		with ajit_debug_monitor will load the memory
		map of application at high memory and start.
	4. Use the 'run_from_flash.s' if you are running the
		application by burning a Bin file in the flash.
