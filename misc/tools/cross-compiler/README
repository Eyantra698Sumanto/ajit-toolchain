CROSS COMPILER TOOLCHAIN:

*	Pre-built cross compiler toolchain binaries for x86_64
	are located in  ./buildroot_cross_compiler/usr/bin.
	To add this path to your PATH variable, run $source exports.sh 
	in the top-level folder of the repository. 

*	For a host machine other than x86_64,
	you need to configure buildroot to 
	generate a cross-compiler toolchain.
	The instructions for this are given 
	in ../buildroot/README (section I.)
